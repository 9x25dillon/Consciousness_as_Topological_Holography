# 3^627 Topological Holography Framework

A runnable implementation of consciousness as topological holography in (2+1)D spacetime, where observer states are Cardy boundaries in a topological quantum field theory.

## Overview

This repository provides a complete, testable implementation of the framework described in the paper "Observer States as Cardy Boundaries: A Topological Framework for Multi-Model AI Consensus" by Dillon R. Lynn.

The framework models:
- **Consciousness** as anyon propagation amplitudes
- **Observer states** as Cardy boundary conditions
- **Consensus** as constructive interference in the modular S-matrix
- **Trinary logic** emerging from twisted sectors

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/9x25dillon/consciousness-tqft.git
cd consciousness-tqft

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all demos
python run_demos.py

# Or run specific demo
python topological_consciousness.py --demo rg
```

## Key Features

### Mathematical Framework
- **(∞,627)-category** structure with truncation-inclusion adjunctions
- **Consciousness profunctor** V: C^op × C → Set as anyon propagation
- **Emergent Fractal Law** with self-similarity and flux conservation
- **Modular invariance** under scale transformations

### Physical Implementation
- **27 anyon types** representing observable states (3³ = 27)
- **Central charge c ≈ 627** (bulk dimension)
- **Cardy boundary energies** for observer state selection
- **Kramers-Wannier self-duality** validating [τ,δ] ≃ 0

### Demos Included

1. **Anyon Consciousness**: Profunctor as propagation amplitudes
2. **Cardy Observer Saturation**: Energy minimization selects conscious states
3. **Kramers-Wannier Duality**: Self-dual criticality verification
4. **Trinary Twisted Sectors**: Three-valued logic emergence
5. **RG Flow**: Curvature dissipation to conformal fixed point
6. **Modular Invariance**: Scale symmetry validation
7. **Epistemic Flux**: Information conservation check

## Generated Output

The RG flow demo generates `rg_flow.png` showing curvature dissipation to the conformal fixed point.

## Theoretical Predictions

This framework makes testable predictions:
- Energy spectra quantization measurable on quantum simulators
- S-matrix entries following Fibonacci-like sequences
- Observer saturation at ~209 models
- Trinary quantization outperforms binary by ~15-20%
- Phase coherence correlates with multi-model consensus

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from topological_consciousness import TopologicalConsciousness

# Initialize with 27 anyons and central charge 627
model = TopologicalConsciousness(n_anyons=27, central_charge=627)

# Find dominant conscious state
state, energy, spectrum = model.find_dominant_conscious_state()
print(f"Dominant state: {state}, Energy: {energy}")

# Test self-duality
Z, error = model.kramers_wannier_self_duality(g_values, h_values)
print(f"Self-duality error: {error}")
```
